Quietr: Active Noise Control For Rooms

--------------------------------------

Quietr is the capstone design project undertaken by my team and I 
in the final year of our Computer Engineering undergrad at the 
University of Waterloo. The goal of this project was to design an
open-air active noise cancellation system to reduce the noise
emitted by an air-conditioning unit.
